# H-M-Fashion-Recommendation

This Streamlit Application is based on [H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/overview) Kaggle Competition.

In this competition we are supposed to build a `product recommendation` based on data from previous transactions, as well as from customer and product meta data.

## Data
It consists of 3 csv files & product images:

* articles.csv : Article metadata
* customers.csv: Customer metadata
* transactions_train.csv: Previous purchase details.

In this project we are using streamlit application for data visualization & analysis for the above data.

## Execution

For executing the app you can run [H&MStreamlit.ipynb ](https://github.com/Techn08055/H-M-Fashion-Recommendation/blob/main/H%26MStreamlit.ipynb) in colab


## Limitations:

The work is not yet complete:

* Due to size contraints the App is not yet hosted in any service & the visualisation is still limited.
* The prediction part & summary is still a work in progress.
